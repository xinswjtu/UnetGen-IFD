# UnetGen-IFD

This repository contains the official implementation of our paper titled *"A Novel UNet-Guided Conditional Generative Model for Data Augmentation and Application to Cylindrical Bearings Fault Diagnosis"*. 

The corresponding manuscript has been submitted to the journal for peer review.

The complete source code with detailed annotations and usage instructions will be released shortly after the manuscript review process. ***Please watch this repository for updates.***

Currently, the following modules are released:

* **UNnet-based conditional generative model**: `./models/ours_model.py`
* **CFMM loss function**: `./utils/mcfm.py`
* training losses: `./utils/losses.py`
